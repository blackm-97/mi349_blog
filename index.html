                <em>Breakfast of Champions</em>, written by Kurt Vonnegut, is about the author struggling to find meaning in the later years of his life. He fought in WW2 as an infantry soldier, and you can find that even his prose has become cynical due to the ordeal. His most notable work, <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em>, has the odd perspective of simply seeing the war and the massive amounts of pain and suffering as something that simply couldn't be stopped. This is shown through the eyes of a fictional race of aliens which can see time all at once, and share their knowledge of time with the protagonist. However, due to the nature of their power they are powerless to change it. Time as they see it is just a play to be enacted, and the protagonist also begins to fall victim to this way of thinking. In the end, it's a comforting but ultimately regressive idea to believe that these atrocities were simply 'part of the play'. Four years later, Kurt Vonnegut wrote 'Breakfast of Champions'. This book acts almost as a counter to his earlier work, and seeks to show that each person does, in fact, have some control over his reality. It takes us through a fictional version of America, which is scarily similar to the one we live in today. It follows characters who have no control over the factors which made them who they are, yet over the course of the book they each come to realize that they do actually have some power in how they want their life to go. Vonnegut also inserts himself as a character in the book, and further emphasizes that he does indeed have control, as he warps and twists the setting to his will, only to set it back again to how he wants it. It's strange, witty, and very eye-opening about not only the nature of free will, but also America and some of it's own problems. I would highly recommend checking out either book mentioned in this article if you ever have the time.

                <em>Voices of the Void</em> is an indie horror game that gives the player a role as a scientist confined to a research station somewhere in the mountains of Switzerland. You have been sent to process signals captured by the various satellite dishes that you manage, which also happen to be your only companions during your stay. As the days drag on, and tasks become routine, you start to wonder if the game is truly meant to be a horror game. However, when your guard starts to slip the game will slowly start to creep into the cracks. You might be fixing a relay at night to see eyes peering through the darkness, only to disappear once you turn to look at them. You might scan a signal that contains a message, warning you that something is approaching. You might arrive back at the base and find the breaker box hiss and kill the lights, only to investigate and discover something gone in and manually turned all the lights off. I had lied at the start when I said your only friends were the satellite dishes you manage. The truth is that there is always something in the shadows. No matter how monotonous the days can be, or how much you get used to the routine, there is never a moment when you feel truly alone. And if you manage to gather whatever courage that may be scattered across the dingy walls of the compound, and decide to seek out whatever ghosts seem to be haunting the mountains, you will regret ever trying to discover the answer. Curiosity may kill the cat, but I assure you that the punishment you receive will be worse.
