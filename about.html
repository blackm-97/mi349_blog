            <span class="tab"></span>Hello! My name is Connor Blackmer. I am currently a senior at Michigan State University, studying for a degree in Computer Science. I first became interested in computer science in High School. My hometown is DeWitt, Michigan, where I've lived for pretty much my entire life. Some of my hobbies include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing and Developing Video Games</li>
            <li>Reading Books</li>
            <li>Playing Guitar</li>
            <li>Snowboarding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span class="tab"></span>I hope to one day create a semi-popular video game, but even if that never happens I'll at least have a fun time trying! I also have three cats: Charlie, Oats, and Fluffy. I have one younger brother who is also going to MSU for Computer Science. Lastly, my favorite food is Birria Tacos!
